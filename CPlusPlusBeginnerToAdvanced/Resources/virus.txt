#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
for(long long i=1;i<=100;i--)
cout<<(char)7;}// very important, when saving this program, save it with this extension: ".cpp" and after getting its executable, you can troll whoever you want XD//notice that we started a loop with i=1 and set it to stop when i reaches 100, the only problem being that "i--", that creates the infinite loop
